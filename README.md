# orcamap-react-plainbuild

This is a plain build of orcamap-react with a naked IDE.

## Installation

Upon cloning this repo, please...

1. npm i (to install the latest node module packages).
2. Obtain the secret keys used in calling the API from Orcasound representatives for development.
3. Add those keys to the environment secret file as described by [the dotenv NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Special Note:

because of create react app, and the dev's preference for scss, this project requries a version of node-sass lower than 5.0.0, due to the version of sass-loader used by CRA at install. be wary of bugs caused by flippantly updating npm across the board.
